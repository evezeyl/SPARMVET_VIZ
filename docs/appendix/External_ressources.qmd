# External ressources worth to look at 


- **Microreact:** It uses a "Data Contract" (CSV + Newick tree) - Learn from their CSV structure. #TODO - 

- **Dash Bio:** (unknown to me) Great for specific plots (Volcano, Manhattan) but lacks the easy multi-page layout of Shiny. #TODO

- **Galaxy Interactive Tools (GxIT):** Most existing GxITs use R/Shiny. By using **Shiny for Python**, you are at the cutting edge of the Galaxy ecosystem. #TODO
