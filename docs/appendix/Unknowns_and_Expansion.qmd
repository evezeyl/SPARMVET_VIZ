# Unknowns and Expansion

- We have tried to find the balance between modularization, letting the possibility to expand the app in the future, not over-engineering it (unsure about that), and speed of obtaining a prototype.

Further requirements to take into consideration (if upscaling) : 

- [ ] Data volume -> polars should be ok, lazy evaluation 
- [ ] Data variety : Species gap (Table structure)
