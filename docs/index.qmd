# Introduction {.unnumbered}

We aimed to build a proffessional dashbord that could be employed to visualize data produced by bioinformatic pipelines hosted:  
- on "Use Galaxy" based platform
- local "IRIDA" based platform
- Or to allow user to upload results produced by galaxy pipelines and visualize them on the dashboard. 

> Prototyping option: User upload results and metadata


We hoped that this work will not only be a deliverable of a short-term project. Consequently we attempted to build a professional, scalable app. Thus we have built a "Walking Skeleton", and adopted a **Layered Architecture**.

The **Decoupling approach** of the different aspects of the app should improve layer reusability and maintainability.
