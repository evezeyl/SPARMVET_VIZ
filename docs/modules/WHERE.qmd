### Tier 2: The Orchestrator (Metadata Join & Filter)

*   **Input:**  bio_wrangle (tidy_data + User uploaded metadata).

*   **Action:** This layer validates the metadata. If the user uploads "messy" data, this layer catches it and sends a "Tidy your data!" error back to the UI.
*   **Crucial Logic:** This is where **Server-Side Filtering** happens. When a user clicks a filter in Shiny, we don't filter in the browser; we tell Polars on the server: `df.filter(pl.col("species") == "E. coli")`.
*   **Why:** This keeps the browser light. You can process millions of rows in Polars on the server, and the user's computer only sees the final 1,000 rows.


- [ ] TODO include report : **"Data Health Report"** -> data and metadata failed to join: cols, row (will be sample_id)


`MetadataManager` that handles the Polars join and validation logic?** ->  "Server-side" engine.
