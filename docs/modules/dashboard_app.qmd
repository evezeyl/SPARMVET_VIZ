# Dashboard App Layer:  `app_shell` module

## Architecture context

### Role

Provides the Dashboard User Interface (UI) and handles Reactivity.


- We choose to use **Shiny Express** for prototyping. But changes are not excluded should this app evolve into a more complex app.

- It handles the sidebar, the file upload buttons, and the "Reactivity" (e.g., "When the user clicks E. coli, update the graph").

### Placement
- server 

### Architectural Benefit

Keeping this file "thin" (only UI and reactivity) makes it much easier to debug,
faster tp o load, and easier to maintain.

- Tidy data preparation BEFORE it touches the UI (shiny express app) makes it much faster to load (more data) and easier to debug. 

- [ ] TODO will require Docker to run into Galaxy (worse case scenario we go back to Shiny Core)
- [ ] TODO : persistence eg. user preferences -> account (could be in a YAML file)

- Shiny Express (the language) and Standard Shiny (the deployment),


## A reminder note on the different Shinny flavors 

| Flavor | Architecture | Pros (Advantages) | Cons (Inconveniences) | Best Use Case |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Standard Shiny (Server)** | **Client-Server:** Python runs on a remote server/container. | High performance for large genomic data; keeps source code/data secure on server. | Requires a live server or Docker container (GxIT) running 24/7. | **Large datasets** or BioBlend integrations. |
| **Shinylive (WASM)** | **Serverless:** Python is compiled to WASM and runs in the user's browser. | No server needed; can be shared as a single static HTML file or via GitHub Pages. | Slow initial load (downloads Python runtime); limited by user's RAM/CPU. | **Lightweight reports** or "frozen" results for a paper. |
| **Shiny Express** | **Developer API:** A streamlined way to write either of the above. | Fastest way to build; very little boilerplate code; highly readable. | Less "fine-grained" control over complex nested layouts compared to "Core." | **Walking Skeletons** and rapid prototyping. |


## Implementation choices

- **Species switch**
    - [ ] ToDecide -> need to look at the data --> choices
        - Included in data (specified in Data contract for each species specified in YAML config file)
        - specified by user (dropdown in Dashboard)
