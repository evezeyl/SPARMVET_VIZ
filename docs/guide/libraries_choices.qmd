# Libraries choices


- Polars : for data tidying and querying 
- plotnine : to allow grammar of graphics factory plots: you’re prioritizing high-quality, publication-ready visuals and a very clean, declarative syntax.
- plotly : at a later stage to  allow interactive exploration


Possibilities
- `plotly.tools.mpl_to_plotly` OR hybrid approach. (To increase interactivity)
