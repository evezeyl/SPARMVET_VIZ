# Handoff — Active State (2026-05-10 continued session)

**Branch:** dev  
**Working tree:** clean (all changes committed)  
**Status:** Session focus: Audit-driven quick wins. Completed 3 library/dependency tasks.

## Session Accomplishments (2026-05-10 afternoon)

### Completed Tasks

1. **LIB-TESTS-BLUEPRINT-1** ✅ `[sonnet/medium]`  
   188 pytest failures → **0 failures (194/194 tests passing)**  
   Root cause: Test file was importing `AVAILABLE_WRANGLING_ACTIONS` (function dict) instead of `ACTION_SCHEMAS` (schema dict) from transformer.actions.base  
   Fix: Changed imports and `register()` call in `libs/blueprint_arch/tests/test_schema_registry.py`  
   Result: All 58 action catalog tests + 36 component catalog tests + semantic rule tests now pass
   
2. **PKG-PLOTNINE-PATCH-1** ✅ `[haiku/low]`  
   Upgraded plotnine 0.15.3 → 0.15.4 per ADR-036 (Plotnine Parity Mandate)  
   Pinned version in pyproject.toml: `plotnine>=0.15.4,<0.16.0`  
   Re-ran parity audit: 222 plotnine symbols, 168 registered (75% coverage)  
   New components identified (geom_bin2d, stat_bin2d, stat_pointdensity) — registration deferred to BP-ACTION-PARITY-1
   
3. **PKG-IMPORTLIB-MAJOR-1** ✅ `[sonnet/low]`  
   Investigated importlib_metadata 9.0.0 upgrade (MAJOR version bump)  
   Found breaking change: opentelemetry-api 1.41.1 (pulled by shiny) requires importlib-metadata<8.8.0  
   Solution: Pinned importlib_metadata to >=6.0,<9.0.0 in pyproject.toml  
   Verified: `pip check` reports no broken requirements

**Next session:** Remaining audit-driven items in "Do Now":
  - **DOC-GAP-1** `[sonnet/medium]` — Expand `docs/workflows/ui_persona.qmd` with 4 missing items (Eight Personas, ADR-076 agent flags, ADR-077 cascade table, panel type table)
  - **DOC-GAP-4** `[haiku/low]` — Triage 8 orphaned `.qmd` files not in `_quarto.yml`

---

## What this session accomplished

This session was a dedicated audit triage session. Two agents ran:

1. **This agent (main session):** Ran Routines §10–12 (library tests, package deps, parity coverage), defined and ran Routines §17–19 (agent-based: semantic doc sync, ADR compliance, three-source persona consistency). Filed all findings as tasks. Updated registry.

2. **Parallel agent (documentation audit):** Ran a 4-part documentation audit (READMEs, docstrings, propagation, docs_tree). Fixed DOC-DRIFT-1 (6 files) and DOC-DRIFT-EMOJI (9 emoji violations) in-session. Filed DOC-GAP-1 through DOC-GAP-4 as tasks.

**All 19 audit routines now have a first-run result.** All audit log files start with `Status: PROCESSED`. The audit infrastructure is fully operational.

---

## Open tasks filed this session (priority order)

### Highest priority — ADR violation

- **ADR-078-ACTIONS-1** `[sonnet/medium]` — Retrofit `SPARMVET_DiagnosticError` into 5 transformer actions that silently `return lf` on invalid input instead of raising the required error type. Files:
  - `libs/transformer/src/transformer/actions/cleaning/expressions.py:40` — `action_regex_extract`
  - `libs/transformer/src/transformer/actions/cleaning/expressions.py:187` — `action_mutate`
  - `libs/transformer/src/transformer/actions/cleaning/analytical.py:29` — `action_window_agg`
  - `libs/transformer/src/transformer/actions/cleaning/analytical.py:64` — `action_shift`
  - `libs/transformer/src/transformer/actions/cleaning/advanced.py:27` — `action_split_and_explode`
  - After those 5, scan rest of `analytical.py` and `advanced.py` for the same pattern.

### Documentation gaps (content creation)

- **DOC-GAP-5** `[haiku/low]` — Fix ExcelHandler class claim in `libs/ingestion/README.md` (no class exists, only `main()` CLI) and "Comparison Theater" stale terminology in `libs/transformer/README.md`. Both READMEs need rewriting to match actual implementation.
- **DOC-GAP-1** `[sonnet/medium]` — Expand `docs/workflows/ui_persona.qmd`: 8 personas, ADR-076 blueprint agent flag, ADR-077 cascade table, ADR-073 panel type table.
- **DOC-GAP-2** `[haiku/low]` — Add demo-vetinst and web-demo rows to `persona_traceability_matrix.md`.
- **DOC-GAP-3** `[haiku/low]` — Add ADR-074 lineage API note to `docs/deployment/deployment_guide.qmd`.
- **DOC-GAP-4** `[haiku/low]` — Triage 8 orphaned `.qmd` files not in `_quarto.yml`.

### Library tests & infrastructure

- **LIB-TESTS-BLUEPRINT-1** `[sonnet/medium]` — 188 pytest failures in `blueprint_arch/tests/test_schema_registry.py`. Root cause: `@register_plot_component` decorators missing `allow_extra_params` / `wraps` ui_schema fields (ADR-075). Fix: add fields to viz_factory component registrations.
- **LIB-TESTS-VIZ-TIMEOUT-1** `[haiku/low]` — Increase timeout for viz_factory integrity suite in `audit_library_tests.py` (currently times out at 120s; suite renders 193+ components).
- **PKG-PLOTNINE-PATCH-1** `[haiku/low]` — Upgrade plotnine 0.15.3 → 0.15.4 (parity mandate); check changelog; re-run parity audit.
- **PKG-IMPORTLIB-MAJOR-1** `[sonnet/low]` — Investigate `importlib_metadata` MAJOR update (8.7.1 → 9.0.0); determine if safe to allow.

## Known open questions / things to verify next session

### Transformer integrity suite 60/62 internal failures

The transformer integrity suite exits 0 (audit script sees PASS) but internally reports 60/62 action failures. Root cause: ADR-078 — actions now raise `SPARMVET_DiagnosticError` when run without proper test TSV data, but the integrity suite was written pre-ADR-078 and doesn't provide the required data context. The suite's exit code doesn't reflect these internal failures.

**This needs a decision:** is the fix (a) update the integrity suite to provide test data for each action so ADR-078 diagnostic errors don't fire, or (b) reclassify these as expected failures and document them? Not filed as a task yet — needs discussion first. This is connected to ADR-078-ACTIONS-1: fixing the 5 silent-passthrough actions is independent, but the broader suite/ADR-078 relationship needs resolution.

### Routine §9 (Documentation & README Sync) still `[ ] Planned`

Routine §9 is the *script-based* doc sync (checks paths, Violet Law references, `@deps` doc links). It is distinct from Routine §17 (agent-based semantic doc sync, which ran this session). The script for §9 (`scripts/audit_docs_sync.py`) has not been written yet. Status matrix correctly shows `[ ] Planned`. No urgency — Routine §17 covers the semantic layer; §9 adds structural/path checking. File a task when ready to implement.

### viz_factory README component count drift (175 → 195)

Routine §17 flagged viz_factory README claiming 175 components vs 195 actual. Marked informational — count drifts naturally with new `@register_plot_component` additions (DECO-2 wave added 20). No task filed; update at next viz_factory sprint.

---

## Audit infrastructure state (for reference)

All 19 routines registered and run at least once:
- §1–16: script-based, most scheduled weekly/monthly. All PASS on first run except §10 (FAIL) and §11 (FAIL/WARNING).
- §17 Semantic doc sync: FIRST RUN ⚠️ — 3 STALE items found, all converted to tasks (DOC-GAP-5 + viz_factory count informational).
- §18 ADR compliance: FIRST RUN ❌ — ADR-078 VIOLATION in 5 actions → ADR-078-ACTIONS-1.
- §19 Three-source persona consistency: FIRST RUN ✅ — all 8 personas clean.

Exclusions file: `.claude/workflows/audit_exclusions.yaml` — added `theme_legend_position` and `theme_publication` as SPARMVET-specific custom components (not plotnine exports). These prevented false-positive stale component alerts in Routine §12.

---

## Session 2026-05-22 — Legacy removals + TEST_LAB scaffold

### Completed this session

**TL-UI-SCAFFOLD-1** — Manifest Scaffolding panel fully wired in `app/handlers/test_lab_handlers.py`. Replaced 3-line stub with full reactive panel: multi-file upload, project ID, join key, optional metadata TSV, reconciliation bake-in controls (conditional on `_recon_results()`), run gate, ZIP download. Stateless tool principle maintained.

**LEGACY-FLAT-WRANGLING-1** — Flat `wrangling: []` lists now raise `ManifestError` in `_resolve_tier()`. Two manifests migrated. 8 tests added in `libs/transformer/tests/test_data_wrangler.py`. Docs swept: `rules_data_engine.md`, `Standards_yaml.qmd`, `transformer/README.md`, `architecture_decisions.md ADR-024`.

**LEGACY-TYPE-ALIASES-1** — Previously completed (carried over from prior session).
